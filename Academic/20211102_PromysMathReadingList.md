## Number Theory

[U] Andrews: Number Theory — A good introductory text with some unusual combinatorial proofs.

[U] Apostol; Introduction to Analytic Number Theory — A good introduction to both analytic number theory and to many topics which the PROMYS number theory covers lightly. Some familiarity with calculus is assumed and the last few chapters assume some knowledge of complex analysis.

[U/G] Borevich & Shafarevich: Number Theory — A beautifully written “introduction” to the more advanced aspects of modern algebraic number theory. Hard to read without a strong background in such things.

[G] Cohen: A Course in Computational Algebraic Number Theory — Your number one source for algorithms in computational algebraic number theory.

[U] Cohn: Advanced Number Theory — This book, as its name suggests, is fairly advanced but it is quite accessible. It is a good book to read after PROMYS, especially if Z[√-5] upsets you.

[G] Janusz: Algebraic Number Fields — A readable introduction to class field theory for someone who knows Galois theory; technically it requires no knowledge of algebraic number theory, but a previous book on the topic may help.

[U] Khinchin: Continued Fractions – An extensive treatment, elementary in the beginning, but difficult toward the end.

[U] Khinchin: Three Pearls of Number Theory — A very beautiful little book, but difficult.

[G] Koblitz: p-adic Numbers, p-adic Analysis, and Zeta-Functions — A very good and readable introduction to p-adics. Feel free to skip chapter two, as it is far more advanced than the rest of the book and is not used later.

[U/G] Lekkerkerker: Geometry of Numbers — With a name like Lekkerkerker, how can you go wrong? The standard, comprehensive treatment of Minkowski theory. Generalizes and applies Minkowski’s theorem in enough ways to kill a horse.

[U] Marcus: Number Fields. — One of the most readable introductions to algebraic number theory. It’s good to have seen rings and some Galois theory before.

[G] Neukirch: Algebraic Number Theory – An extremely comprehensive, streamlined and sophisticated resource, including a treatment of axiomatic class field theory and the Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch theorem; requires a lot of background to appreciate.

[U/G] Atiyah & Macdonald: Commutative Algebra. — A short introduction to the algebra needed in algebraic geometry. College-level. Many good problems.

[U] Artin, Emil: Galois Theory — A beautiful presentation. Ridiculously slick; there are no problems, so take care to redo all the proofs.

[U] Artin, Michael: Algebra — A classic. Has a wonderful collection of problems. Highly recommended.

[G] Bourbaki: Algebra, Commutative Algebra, Integration, Topological Vector Spaces, etc. — These are technically parts of the same volume, but they are so massive they each come in their own book. Bourbaki does everything in the utmost generality. It can be unwieldy, but the algebra books are done quite nicely, and a lot of the material is not found anywhere else because no one else wants to write foundational books.

[U] Burn: Groups, a Path to Geometry — Lots of applications.

[U] Cox, Little & O’Shea: Ideals, Varieties and Algorithms — A very accessible introduction to basic ideas from computational algebraic geometry.

[G] Eisenbud: Commutative Algebra with a View Toward Algebraic Geometry — A very comprehensive commutative algebra book with loads of excellent exercises. Too unwieldy to be used as an introduction, but an excellent place to go for all sorts of interesting, modern commutative algebra.

Very dense and fast moving; this should not be your first book on Abstract Algebra. Out of print, but can be bought online.

[U] James and Liebeck: Representations and Characters of Groups — Very accessible introduction to the representation theory of groups. The focus is on finite groups, but there is a chapter on GL(2,q), two chapters on applications to group theory, and a chapter on the applications of character theory to molecular vibrations.

[U] Lang: Linear Algebra — Standard undergraduate book.

[U] Lang: Undergraduate Algebra — Concise, but easier than Herstein. Excellent for learning.

[G] Lang: Algebra — The standard reference for abstract algebra. Much more difficult to learn from than the above book, but indispensable as a reference.

[U] Brylawski: Studies in Combinatorics — One of a super series edited by Rota and put out by the MAA.

[U] Chung and Graham: Erdos on Graphs — A compilation of Erdos’ work on graphs with a huge collection of open problems and their status. If you’re looking for a challenging and intriguing graph theory conjecture to try your hand at, or for the current status of most graph theory questions, look here.

[U] Cohen, D. I. A. : Introduction to Combinatorial Mathematics — One of the best introductions to combinatorics and combinatorial reasoning.

[U/G] Comtet: Advanced Combinatorics — Advanced and somewhat old-fashioned, but good when you have mastered the basics.

[G] May: A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology — The title says it all. It contains everything there is to know about algebraic topology, including an extremely thorough treatment of homotopy theory. It is also frighteningly concise and modern; as a result it prepares you to start reading modern research papers directly. Not for the faint of heart, but a very rewarding read if you give it the patience it deserves.

[U/G] Massey: A Basic Course in Algebraic Topology — Readable, lots of examples. Combines much of his Algebraic Topology: An Introduction and Singular Homology Theory.

[U] Milnor: Topology from the Differentiable Viewpoint — A good introduction to differential topology. Very concise and elegant.

[U/G] Coxeter: Introduction to Geometry — This is geometry as it ought to be done.

[G] Dubrovin, Fomenko, Novikov: Modern Geometry — Methods and Applications. — 3 volumes. A comprehensive treatment of topology and geometry that never loses sight of visual intuition. Requires college-level mathematical maturity.

[U] Greenberg, Marvin: Euclidean and Non-Euclidean Geometry: Development and History — An excellent introduction with a lot of motivation and history.

[G] Hartshorne: Algebraic Geometry — A standard reference for the scheme-theoretic viewpoint of algebraic geometry. Contains many exercises, as notorious as they are pedagogically sound. Should be read in conjunction with a more classically-minded text, such as Shafarevich’s Basic Algebraic Geometry, Mumford’s Complex Projective Varieties, or Harris’s Algebraic Geometry: A First Course.

[G] Griffiths and Harris: Principles of Algebraic Geometry — Algebraic geometry from an entirely analytic point of view. Very classical, very beautiful, and very difficult; fundamentally different in flavor, texture, and color from the other books on this list.

[G] Thurston: Three-Dimensional Topology and Geometry. — Visual intuition is stressed over rigor. Lots of great exercises.

[U] Yaglom: Geometric Transformations — A delightful book.

## Calculus and Analysis

[U/G] Ahlfors: Complex Analysis — The standard first graduate textbook.

[U] Apostol: Calculus (Vols. 1 and 2) — The second-best calculus text out there. Also contains several-variable calculus and some linear algebra.

[U] Apostol: Mathematical Analysis — More difficult and more abstract than Buck, but valuable and readable. It continues where Buck leaves off, but should be accessible after any good elementary course.

[U] Boas: A Primer of Real Functions — A fun book on real analysis; focuses on giving interesting examples and cool facts rather than difficult machinery.

[U] Buck: Advanced Calculus — A classic. Highly recommended.

[U/G] Cartan: Elementary Theory of Analytic Functions of One or Several Complex Variables — Cartan's book is a brisk and rigorous introduction to complex analysis. It is complex analysis absolutely done right. Perfect for those comfortable with a fairly high level of abstraction.

[U] Conway, John B.: Functions of One Complex Variable — Another excellent text on complex analysis, but more difficult than Ahlfors.

[U] deBruijn: Asymptotic Methods in Analysis — Explains how to compute the rates of growth of solutions to functions defined by integrals, differential equations or implicitly with many examples. Although it does not cover applications to combinatorics, combinatorialists will find it helpful.

[U] Keisler, H. Jerome: Elementary Calculus: An Infinitesimal Approach — Keisler's book is an alternative approach to Calculus using the idea of an infinitesimal rather than epsilon-delta. It does not assume any calculus and is available for free online.

[U] Knopp: Sequences and Series — A beautiful little book.

[U] Knopp: Theory of Functions (Three Volumes and Two Problem Books) — An introduction to functions of a complex variable; requires a high degree of sophistication; the problem books are especially good.

[U] Kuga: Galois’ Dream — A really fun book introducing groups, differential equations, and one of their connections, the surprising world of differential Galois theory.

[U] Pugh, Charles Chapman: Real Mathematical Analysis — An absolutely fantastic introduction to Analysis, it has excellent exposition and is full of great examples and over 500 (good) exercises. A counterpart to Rudin, Pugh always builds up machinery first and uses it to provide very clear proofs that grant a good sense of "why" something is true. Judging by page count and the amount of material it covers, it seems that it must be as concise as Rudin, yet it reads very easily.

[U] Rudin: Principles of Mathematical Analysis — An accessible, traditional introduction to hard analysis. The first half is good, but the last few chapters are not a good place to learn about differential forms and Lebesgue integration.

[G] Rudin: Real and Complex Analysis — An excellent text combining real and complex analysis, starting with a good introduction to measure and integration theory.

[U] Schey: Div, Grad, Curl and all that — An excellent book for understanding multivariable calculus.

[U/G] Shakarchi and Stein: Princeton Lectures in Analysis — The new standard textbook for Fourier analysis (volume I), complex analysis (volume II), and real analysis and measure theory (volume III).  When volume IV comes out, it will have a hodgepodge of topics in modern analysis, such as distribution theory. Blows all other analysis books out of the water in quality of exposition, clarity, and depth.

[U] Spivak: Calculus — Spivak takes the honors as the best introductory calculus text: a thorough treatment of the subject beautifully written.

[U] Spivak: Calculus on Manifolds — This standard reference is a classical approach to multivariable calculus, manifolds and differential forms, making them painful, ugly and confusing.

[G] Stein: Introduction to Fourier Analysis on Euclidean Spaces — A rigorous introduction to Fourier analysis on Euclidean spaces, with an emphasis on operators and interpolation.

[U/G] Whittaker & Watson: Modern Analysis — The classic text on complex variables and transcendental functions, includes an excellent section on the Jacobi theta functions. The beginning is a very thorough, though nonstandard, course on complex analysis. 

## Probability

[U] Adams and Guillemin: Measure Theory and Probability – A good introduction to measure theory, emphasizing applications to probability theory. The second half deals with Fourier analysis and Lebesgue integration.

[G] Dudley: Real Analyis and Probability — A fairly sophisticated and advanced introduction. Very complete and gives concise proofs.

[U] Feller: An Introduction to Probability Theory and its Applications — The standard reference.

[U] Larsen and Marx: An Introduction to Mathematical Statistics and its Applications — Fun to read.

[U] Ebbinghaus, Flum, and Thomas: Mathematical Logic — A good introduction to first-order logic, Gödel’s Incompleteness Theorem, and Model Theory.

[U] Enderton, Herbert: A Mathematical Introduction to Logic — Enderton's strong points are that the book is concise, very simple, and does a great job of connecting logic with other fields of math (such as Algebra and Analysis).

[U] Hofstadter, D.: Gödel, Escher, Bach, an Eternal Golden Braid — A witty guide to Gödel’s proof and related philosophical ideas.

[G] Krivine: Introduction to Axiomatic Set Theory — A complete introduction; very dense.

[U] Russell: Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy — A classic and accessible, though somewhat dated introduction.

[U/G] Smorynski: Logical Number Theory I — Does basic logic with a heavy focus on Number Theory applications; includes clear proofs of Gödel’s theorem and Hilbert’s Tenth Problem (that there exists no algorithm to decide whether a Diophantine equation is solvable.) Volume II was never published.

[U] Smullyan: Forever Undecided : A Puzzle Guide to Gödel — This book uses liar/truthteller puzzles to walk you through Gödel’s proof.

[U] Vaught: Set Theory — A readable, thorough and rigorous undergraduate introduction.

## Computers

Abelson and Sussman: Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs — A sophisticated view of programming languages. Teaches in Scheme, a dialect of Lisp. You should not try to learn Scheme from this book. This books describes how to compute (with a computer) numerical values of mathematical expressions. Read this either to find out how Mathematica and cousins work, or when you need something they won’t do. Although a new edition came out in the 90’s, very little has been changed since the 1970 version.

# Student Resources

We hope that this site can serve as a place where students searching for information about math can find what they are looking for. If you know of great resources for math students, please send them to [communities@maa.org](mailto:communities@maa.org) and we'll see if we can fit them on the site.

#### Resources for High School Students

While the MAA's focus is mathematics at the collegiate level, we also house and connect to a wealth of resources for high school students. Explore our [resources for high school students](https://www.maa.org/member-communities/students/student-resources/high-school) to find lists of summer programs, information about mathematics competitions, information about choosing mathematics as a college major, and much more!

#### Resources for Undergraduate Students

The MAA's mission is to promote mathematics at the collegiate level, and many of our efforts directly involve undergraduate students. Take a look at our [undergraduate student page](https://www.maa.org/member-communities/students/student-resources/undergraduate) for information about research, careers, meetings, and many other opportunities and materials you might find interesting.

#### Resources for Graduate Students

Check out our [graduate student page](https://www.maa.org/member-communities/students/student-resources/graduate) for information about fellowships, finding a job, teaching, more.

#### Other Organizations

In addition to the [MAA](https://www.maa.org/member-communities/students/student-resources), there are a variety of special professional mathematical sciences organizations:

The [American Mathematical Association of Two-Year Colleges](http://www.amatyc.org/) (AMATYC) is the only organization exclusively devoted to providing a national forum for the improvement of the instruction of the mathematics in the first two years of college.

The [American Mathematical Society](http://www.ams.org/) (AMS), through its programs and services, aims to promote mathematical research and its uses, strengthen mathematical education, and foster awareness and appreciation of mathematics and its connections to other disciplines and to everyday life.

The [American Statistical Association](http://www.amstat.org/) (ASA) is a scientific and educational society founded to promote excellence in the application of statistical science.

The [Association for Computing Machinery](http://www.acm.org/) (ACM) is a professional organization whose main goal is advancing the skills of information technology professionals and students worldwide.

The [Association for Women in Mathematics](http://www.awm-math.org/) (AWM) is dedicated to encouraging women and girls in the mathematical sciences.

The [Computing Research Organization](http://www.cra.org/) (CRA) is an organization of academic departments of computer science and related fields whose mission is to strengthen research and education in computing, to expand opportunities for women and minorities, and to improve public understanding of the importance of computing.

The [Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences](http://www.informs.org/) (INFORMS) is a professional organization that helps practitioners apply scientific tools and methods to improve systems and operations and to assist in managerial decision making.

The [National Association of Mathematians](http://www.math.buffalo.edu/mad/NAM/index.html) (NAM) promotes excellence in the mathematical sciences and the mathematical development of underrepresented minorities.

The [National Council of Teachers of Mathematics](http://www.nctm.org/) (NCTM) serves the needs of mathematics teachers at all levels from elementary school teachers through college professors.

The [Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics](http://www.siam.org/) (SIAM) promotes the development of the mathematical methods needed in a variety of applications areas.

The [Society of Actuaries](http://www.soa.org/) (SOA) has as its mission, to advance actuarial knowledge and to enhance the ability of actuaries to provide expert advice and relevant solutions for financial, business, and societal problems involving uncertain future events.
